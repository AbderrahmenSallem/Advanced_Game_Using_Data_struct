PS : I didn't read the instructions given in the classroom, I saw them today for the first time,
thus my inability make a code that satisfies the your request .


. I poured all the prior knowledge of c that I had + what I learned in class in this code 
(data structures/custom types/pointers/memeory managment/files)

. I provided you with 2 copies : 

	1st copy is the one That I coded till the very end 

	2nd copy is the one that I sent over to chatGpt to provide me with the required commenting as well as to help me quickly prepare 
					   the documentation .


So After Checking the Classroom today I found out that you requested a competetion of type with preliminary rounds and official rounds.
That can be easily achieved by adding such an option to the menu, and my code already will not allow you to advance after making a mistake
,which is the logic behind the competetion algorithm
also for the money logic I have a score counter that keeps the value updated all I have to do is add a money_gained variable to the game

That's about it ig .

PS : I focused on the coding aspect of the game not the visuals since I wanted to impliment everthing I know of .
