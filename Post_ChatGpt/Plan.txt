Make a Load function
Will load the Tree when called
Functions : {loadQuestions,LoadPlayers, LoadPlayers}

Screens :
1) Login/SignUp
2) Menu : {play,check score, leaderboard(100 playerD)}

updating score : {update file and reload(using function load()) || update tree and update file by the end} : it will require an optimization since I made it open a file to check if there it needs to update while I could've just checked the class I have loaded
